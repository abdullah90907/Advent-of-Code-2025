## ✅ What is Advent of Code?

**Advent of Code** is an annual event featuring small, Christmas-themed programming puzzles that have captivated developers worldwide since its launch on December 1, 2015, by **Eric Wastl**.

### Key Features:
- 🎯 **Daily Puzzles**: Each calendar day unlocks a new puzzle with two parts—part 2 becomes available only after solving part 1
- 💻 **Language Agnostic**: Solutions can be written in any programming language
- 🌍 **For Everyone**: From hobbyists to experienced developers, anyone with basic programming knowledge can participate
- 🎓 **Learning Focus**: Perfect for learning new languages, sharpening coding skills, interview prep, or just having fun
- 🏆 **Personal Challenge**: Not about competition—it's about personal growth and problem-solving

---

## 🎯 What's Special About Advent of Code 2025?

This year brings exciting changes to the traditional format:

### 🆕 New Format:
- **12 Days of Puzzles** instead of the traditional 25 days (still starting December 1)
- **No Global Leaderboard**: The emphasis has shifted from worldwide competition to personal challenge and private-group fun
- **Same Great Quality**: The event remains free and accessible to everyone

### Why These Changes Matter:
- ✨ More focus on learning and enjoying the puzzles at your own pace
- 🤝 Better for team collaboration and learning exercises
- 🎄 Maintains the holiday spirit without the pressure of racing against thousands
